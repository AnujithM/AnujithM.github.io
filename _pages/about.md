<span style="font-size: 14px;">I am currently working as a Research Associate under the guidance of [M. Hanmandlu](https://ctech.iitd.ac.in/hanmandlu.html), IIT Delhi. Previously, I held the position of Research Associate 2 at the [I3D lab](https://cambum.net/I3D.htm) of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, guided by [Pradipta Biswas](https://cambum.net/PB/), focusing on human-robot interaction. I completed my undergraduate studies at RIT, Kottayam, specializing in Electronics and Communication Engineering. During my time at RIT, I was as an Undergraduate Researcher at the Centre for Advanced Signal Processing ([CASP lab](http://www.rit.ac.in/ece/CASP/)) under mentorship of [Manju Manuel](http://www.rit.ac.in/fprofiledisplay.php?penno=603400&dep=ECE), where I worked on FPGA design and implementation.</span>.

Research interests
======
<span style="font-size: 14px;">My research interests lie at the intersection of reinforcement learning and robotic perception, focusing on developing systems capable of operating in unstructured, human-centric environments while formulating policies for safe and efficient human collaboration</span>.

<!-- **Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository. -->
